Gridsome generates static files when running the `gridsome build` command. By default it outputs to the `dist` directory.
Since these are simple HTML and JS files you only need a server which hosts these files.

If you need more information on this topic, check out the [Gridsome Docs](https://gridsome.org/docs/deploy-to-netlify/) on this issue.
